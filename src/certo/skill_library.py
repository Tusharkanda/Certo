"""Where a run's skills come from, in order, and what `certo skills` shows.

Layers, lowest to highest; a skill replaces one of the same name below it:

1. official: Certo's own, in the package (`certo/builtin_skills/`),
   changed only by a release;
2. third-party, global: `~/.config/certo/skills/`, for every project;
3. third-party, project: `<project>/.certo/skills/`, never in git
   (`.certo/` ignores itself);
4. the project's own `.agents/skills/` and `AGENTS.md`: loaded by the SDK
   itself (`load_project_skills`, which overrides a same-named skill), only
   read here, never written.

A third-party folder holds, at its top level only, `<name>.md` files and
`<name>/SKILL.md` folders. A skill added from a file or folder is on as
soon as it is there; a skill downloaded from git is listed in the folder's
`skills.lock.json` and stays off until enabled, with its license and hash
checked (`third_party_skills.py`). Names starting with a dot (the git
cache, staging) are never skills. Nothing here is loaded recursively: a
git cache holds whole repositories.

Every third-party skill is untrusted text: its inline `` !`command` `` is
escaped and its `.mcp.json` ignored, as for downloaded skills.
