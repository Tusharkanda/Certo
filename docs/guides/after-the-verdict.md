# What to do after each verdict

This guide says what to do next once a run ends, verdict by verdict. It
is for anyone running tasks with `certo`. What each verdict means exactly,
and its exit code, is in [Verdicts](../reference/verdicts.md). Error
messages and their fixes are in [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md).

## Your tools

Five moves cover almost every case:

| Move | Command | When |
|---|---|---|
| Read where it stopped | open `.certo/STATUS.md` in the project | Any failing verdict. It holds the verdict, the failing checks and the end of their output, written by Certo, not by the agent. |
| See the full check output | `certo verify` (or `certo verify PATH`) | Any time. It runs the same checks with no agent and no model, so it costs nothing. |
| Continue with a hint | `certo --resume "..."` | The agent was close, and you can say what it missed. It keeps its earlier conversation. |
| Continue with a stronger model | `certo --resume --model MODEL` | The model is the problem. The new model reads everything the first one did. |
| Start smaller | a new, smaller task in the same folder | The task was too big for one run. |

Add `--project NAME` to `--resume` and `verify` if the task used it. See
[Resume an interrupted run](resume-a-run.md).

## `verified`

The project's checks passed. That proves what the checks test, and
nothing more.

1. **Look at what changed.** In a git repository, `git diff` and
   `git status`. Make sure the agent changed what you asked, and nothing
   else.
2. **Look at the tests.** Do they test what the task asked for, with the
   right expected results? The agent's tests can share its
   misunderstandings (see
   [Write a task Certo can check](write-a-good-task.md#3-give-the-expected-answers-yourself)).
3. **Try it.** Run the program, open the page, call the API. Certo can
   start a program but can't use it the way a person does.
4. **Commit**, so the next task starts from a known state.

To keep working on the same project, run the next task with the same
folder or `--project`. `certo --resume` with no text does nothing after
`verified`; give it the next instruction, or start a new task.

## `inconclusive`

Nothing proved the work right or wrong. The lines starting with `-` under
the verdict say why. The common cases:

- **No tests.** Ask for tests: `certo --resume "Add pytest tests for the
  scoring rules"`.
- **A tool is missing** (`npm`, `go`, `cargo`, `mvn`, `gradle`). Install
  it and run `certo verify`: no need to run the agent again.
- **An unknown project type**, such as a standalone HTML page. Check it by
  hand, or ask for a `package.json` with a `test` or `build` script.
- **Several projects in one folder.** Run `certo verify` in the one you
  mean.

To set a project up so this doesn't happen, see
[Make your project checkable](make-a-project-checkable.md). In scripts and
CI, use `--require-verification` so `inconclusive` counts
as a failure. Each case in detail:
[Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md#inconclusive-the-project-has-no-tests).

## `unchanged`

The checks passed, but the agent changed no file, even after Certo asked
it once. Read the agent's last message: it usually says why.

- **No change was needed** (for example, "check that the tests pass"):
  you're done.
- **A change was needed:** the agent stopped early, misread the task, or
  wrote files somewhere else. Look for files outside the project folder,
  then resume with a precise instruction, such as
  `certo --resume "inventory.py has no OutOfStock class yet. Add it, as the task says."`,
  or with a stronger `--model`.

If this keeps happening on fix tasks, add an
[acceptance check](acceptance-checks.md) for what must exist afterwards.

## `retry_exhausted`

A check kept failing after the fix attempts (2 by default), with a
different failure each time. The agent was trying, but didn't get there.

1. Read the failure: `certo verify`, or the end of it in
   `.certo/STATUS.md`.
2. If you can see the cause, resume with it:
   `certo --resume "The repeated-letter rule is wrong: mark correct letters first, then present ones only while copies remain."`
3. If the model seems out of its depth, resume with a stronger
   `--model`.
4. If the task asked for a lot, split it (see
   [one step per task](write-a-good-task.md#7-one-step-per-task)).

`CERTO_MAX_VERIFY_RETRIES` allows more attempts, but more attempts by the
same model rarely help: a hint or a stronger model usually does.

## `no_progress`

A fix attempt changed nothing: the same check failed with the same
output. Certo stopped early instead of using up the attempts.

Before resuming, ask whether the **test** is wrong rather than the code.
Agents sometimes keep breaking correct code to satisfy a test that expects
the wrong thing. If so, say which one is right:
`certo --resume "test_invalid_move expects a legal move to fail. Fix the test, not the code."`

Otherwise, treat it like `retry_exhausted`: a precise hint, a stronger
model, or a fix by hand followed by `certo verify`.

## `timed_out`

A check ran longer than 300 seconds and was stopped, and it still did
after the fix attempts. Almost always a program or test that waits for
input, or loops forever.

- Certo runs every check with no input. A program that waits for a key
  press, or a test that starts a server and never stops it, hangs here.
- Resume with: `certo --resume "The tests hang. Make the program exit when
  input ends, and stop any server the tests start."`
- A test suite that really needs more than 5 minutes can't pass in Certo
  today: split it, or check that part yourself.

## `incomplete`

The agent's own to-do list still had open items after Certo asked it to
finish them. Certo didn't run the checks: passing tests for part of the
work prove nothing.

This usually means the task was too big for the model. Resume to let it
continue (`certo --resume`), or split the rest into smaller tasks. A
stronger `--model` also helps.

## `acceptance_failed`

Everything else passed, but a required
[acceptance check](acceptance-checks.md) failed. The failing check is
listed under the verdict. Certo doesn't send this back to the agent, so
resume with it:
`certo --resume "README.md needs a ## Usage section."`

If the check itself was wrong (a wrong path, or text that is too strict),
look at the file yourself: `certo verify` doesn't run acceptance checks.
Fix the check before you use it again.

## `independent_failed`

Only with `--independent-tests-strict`. The project's checks passed, but
most sets of [independent tests](independent-tests.md) failed. Each
set's failing tests are named under the verdict. Read them first: an
independent test can be wrong too.

- If the test is right, the work is wrong: resume with what the test
  expects, e.g. `certo --resume "A transfer's two amounts must have
  opposite signs."` Certo doesn't send the tests to the agent.
- If the test is wrong, the work may be fine: the project's own checks
  passed. With `CERTO_ARTIFACTS_DIR` set, the tests are kept in the run's
  record folder so you can check them.

## `budget_exhausted`

The task's time budget (`CERTO_MAX_TASK_SECONDS`, 30 minutes by default)
ran out, and the work so far couldn't be shown to pass: either the
checks failed, or the time ran out before a fix attempt. (If the budget
runs out during the agent's last step and the checks then pass, the
verdict is `verified`.) The work so far is in the folder.

- `certo --resume` continues with a fresh time budget.
- If every step is slow, the model is probably too big for your machine:
  see [Every step is very slow](../troubleshooting.md#every-step-is-very-slow).
- If the task is simply big, split it, or raise `CERTO_MAX_TASK_SECONDS`.

## `stuck`

The agent's run ended stuck (the agent repeated itself) or in an error,
before it finished. Certo didn't check a run that broke off. (A run that
only used all its steps is checked; it ends `stuck` only when nothing
could be checked. If your model often needs more than 50 steps, raise
`CERTO_MAX_ITERATIONS`.)

- Resume once: `certo --resume`, perhaps with a hint.
- With a local model, check the context window first: a model that can't
  see the start of the task any more goes round in circles (see
  [The agent behaves erratically with Ollama](../troubleshooting.md#the-agent-behaves-erratically-with-ollama)).
- If it happens again, use a stronger `--model`.

## `confirmation_required`

Confirm mode (`CERTO_CONFIRM_MODE=always`) needed an approval and nobody
could give it, which happens in server mode. Run the task from the
`certo` command, where you can answer, or turn confirm mode off for
server tasks. See [Interactive and confirm mode](interactive-mode.md).

## With escalation

With `--escalate`, Certo already moves a failing task to the next, stronger
model by itself (see
[what makes Certo climb](escalate-between-models.md#what-makes-certo-climb)).
When the last model also fails, the advice above applies to its verdict.
`--resume` can't be combined with `--escalate`; resume with `--model` set
to the model you want.
